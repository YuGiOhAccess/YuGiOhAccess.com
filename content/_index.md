# YuGiOh Access
### YuGiOh for the blind

Welcome to YuGiOhAccess, a community driven effort to make it possible for blind and visually impaired people to play YuGiOh, the trading card game.

YuGiOhAccess is not a single project, but rather the name for the whole community effort. The community is still in it's infancy, and therefore no single project has matured enough to be the main project that we can recommend to everyone. However, we are working on it, and we are making progress.
